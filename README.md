# BLAS3 (a) (b)

This is a short project about the BLAS3 (basic linear algebra subroutine level 3).
The project focus on implementing and analysing the behaviour of operation (A) and operation (B) of BLAS3.

## (a)
1. Multiplication is done using Strassen algorithm
2. To handle odd dimension matrix, chopping method is used according to R. P. BRENT, _Algorithms for Matrix Multiplication_



Reference for the algorithm:
NICHOLAS J. HIGHAM. _Exploiting Fast Matrix Multiplication_
